Web Scraping and Word Frequency
Task 1: Web Scraping: I have used libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a website [Welcome to Python. org]
And saved the data in a text file.
Task 2: Word Frequency: Created a program that reads a created text file from task 1 and counts the frequency of each word.
